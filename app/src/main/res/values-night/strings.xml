        Avoid dry nurseries.\n
        Avoid late planting.\n
        Burning of straw and stubbles after harvest\n
        Avoid grasses and other weeds on bunds and inside.\n
        Dry seed treatment with Pseudomonas fluorescens talc formulation @10g/kg of seed.\n
        Stagnate water to a depth of 2.5cm over an area of 25m2 in the nursery.\n
        Sprinkle 2.5 kg of P. fluorescens (talc) and mix with stagnated water.\n
        Soak the root system of seedlings for 30 min and transplant.\n

        Seed treatment with carbendazim 2.0g/kg of seeds.\nControl insect pests.\n

    <string name="preventive_measures_leaf_scald">
        Avoid high use of fertilizer.
        Chemicals such as benomyl, carbendazim, quitozene, and thiophanate-methyl can be used to treat the seeds to eliminate the disease.
        In the field, spraying of benomyl, fentin acetate, edifenphos, and validamycin significantly reduce the incidence of leaf scald.
        Foliar application of captafol, mancozeb, and copper oxychloride also reduces the incidence and severity of the fungal disease.
